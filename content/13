Stack post draft and why the command line is often better

First real draft of post on understanding the stack is done. Almost
3000 words. I also made a short 5-10 minute video where I trace a
system call from user space to kernel space and back using GDB. I
think it's pretty cool! Will post it soon.

I don't use this GDB feature that much, but it's pretty neat:

    break syscall.c:160 if num == 8

It breaks at a specific line when the variable num is set to 8. Along
with watchpoint for seeing when a register has changed and the until
<linenumber> I feel confident I can step through most things in GDB.

Why the command line is still better for many tasks. Mission: add
audio to video created at Twitch. Twitch has no way to add audio after
creating a highlight. Export to Youtube. Neither does Youtube
editor. *Download video from YT* After 20m with each, I have no idea
how to do it with iMovie or Quicktime. Bloatware. 5m of google, c/p
first ffmpeg oneliner => works.
