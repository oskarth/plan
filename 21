Preliminary conclusions from practice+SRS experiment


About a week ago I worked on three small problems until I (a) felt like I
understood them (b) solved them in ~5-10m from scratch. After that, I added a
bunch flashcards to a spaced repetition program called Anki. I tried a mix of
cards that are all possible to do in one's head. Examples of types of cards
include:

1. Checks for conceptual understanding
2. Basic debugging: what's wrong with this piece of quote
3. Complete a piece of tricky code
4. Listing exhaustive cases to check for some simple domain
5. Basic syntax and idioms questions

I wrote a RPN calculator in Scheme, a basic aggregation query in SQL, and a word
counter in C. Today I re-did them and was able to solve them all in ~5m. I've
thus not been able to falsify my hypothesis.

What does this mean? I don't know yet, and I'm still skeptical of the results.
Perhaps I simply had these specific solutions fresh in my mind? Where does the
line been memorization and internalization lie?

A thought: Learning is a form of semantic compression of concepts that are
robust under perturbation.

To be continued.
