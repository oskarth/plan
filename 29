Long time no see


Hi there. Today is January 16th, 2017. New plan journal entry, first one in a
very long time. Want to use it as a way to keep myself accountable now that I
don't have a day job. The last few weeks I've been working on a spaced
repetition tool for retaining programming knowledge. I gave myself three weeks
and it's been a few days more than that now, so I really want to get it out
there as soon as possible. Just need to make it reasonably usable and remove the
worst bugs first.

What did I get done today? Let's have a look. As a reminder, "*" means done, " "
not done, "-" I decided against it, and "+" was done at a later date.

* show 'check your inbox' message when registering
* pass through session token properly
* move cards from session cards to user cards when logged in
* accidentally check in mailgun api key (will burn once out of sandbox)
* scheduled cards should check in user-email if user is logged in
  fix review-card command for user null pointer exception
	make checklist of minimum things necessary to launch
