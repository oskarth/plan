Getting started with xv6, a simple Unix-like teaching operating system


Not a lot of coding done today; spent a bunch of time debugging compiler
toolchain things for xv6. Got it to compile by setting up a small VPS with Linux
on it instead of messing around with custom builds of gcc.

Reviewed some shell basics. Apparently there are 382 words in the standard
dictionary that have no a, e, i, o, or u. That's pretty cool.

> grep -Ev 'a|A|e|E|i|I|o|O|u|U' /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l

I started doing the shell homework and realized I needed to brush up on (or,
rather, learn) C. Looked into the course that xv6 is based on and its
prerequisites and here's what I found:

The xv6 booklet is based on the Operating System Engineering course at MIT, 6.828.
This course has, among other things, a pre-requisite of the material in course
6.033 which in turn has a strong pre-requisite 6.004 (which I know probably less
than 50% of). Yelp! Better get to work.
