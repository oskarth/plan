This is my code journal. The todo list at the end of each entry is straight from
Carmack:

> A * entry was completed on that day 
> A + entry was completed on a later day
> A - entry was decided against on a later day.

I try to keep each entry under 200 words. You can see a list of all the entries
at /list. n/a just means there's no title for that entry (usually the case when
the entry is short).

If you want to talk to me, you can email me at oskarth dot com. @I'm oskarth on
Twitter. My main home online is www.oskarth.com (no text-only representation,
unfortunately).
