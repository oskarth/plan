(print "Hello world!")


Today is June 9th, 2015, and I'm restarting my code journal. I'm working on my
own little Lisp interpreter, based on the one described in SICP. My goal is to
get it to a reasonable state by the end of this week, and then we'll see.
Clojuresque data-strucures like vectors, maps and sets would be neat. Right now
I'm more concerned about getting my interpreter environment recognized, though.

On a separate note, I found myself asking questions such as: given that I send
N emails and I think M% will respond, how big of a sample size do I need to be
sure?  Alternatively, if I already have a sample size, what's my response rate?
If you send 5 emails and you think 50% will respond, then everything between 0
and 5 people responding would be within a 95% confidence interval. So I wrote a
little unix util called rrange that computes this. Flipping 40 coins we get:

    > rrange 0.5 40
    Around 20 ~ [14, 26]

* (eval '(lambda (x) x) '())
+ (eval '(((lambda (x) (lambda (y) (+ x y))) 3) 4) '())
* made a little unix util in Racket called rrange
