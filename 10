Pointers


Realized I was glossing over some details when reading code so I decided to go
back to looking at pointers using a little C file I found at MIT's OS class
website. See pointer-notes.c in my K&R repo at Github.

Here are the mistakes I made:

// 1. c[0] = 200 does change value of a, because it is a[0].
// 2. 3[c] = 302, x[i] is syntactic sugar for *(x+i), where x is a pointer.
//    So this would just mean: *(3+c). Presumably that's the same as c+3.
// 3. Changing c doesn't change a, need to check *c for that.
// 4. Casting c+1 into char* then int* doesn't give same, since sizeof char is 1
//    and size of int is 1. So we get an offset of 1 and thus gibberish.
