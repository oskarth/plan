A new hypothesis for practice and retaining knowledge


After my last two experiments I realized spaced repetition only makes sense if
you've learned something. I "knew" this and had certainly read about it, but I
hadn't really internalized it before.

We often learn things and then forget them. One solution is over-learning, which
happens naturally for things we do a lot. I suspect this is one of the reasons
fundamentals are often learned better once we do more advanced things. For
example, if you grow up speaking German pronouns and cases will be ingrained,
because you've dealt with sentences that depended on them for so long.

What about things that are not naturally over-learned, for whatever reason? Can
we learn things once and easily maintain that skill? 

Hypothesis: Given that I've learned something and added multiple cards to my
spaced repetition system (SRS), I'll be able to solve the same problem in
roughly the same amount of time, regardless of how long it's been since I did it
the last time (time-invariant).

This is quite a mouthful and I'll explain what I mean by 'learning', 'cards' and
SRS with more concrete examples in the days to come.
