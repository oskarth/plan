Live streaming and some neat C stuff


Today I live streamed on Twitch for the first time. It was fun! Someone tuned
into the stream and said "What are you doing?" when I was browsing Twitter.
Great anti-procrastination! Here are two things I learned about today:

1. Named/Designated initializers in C.

    int a[6] = { [4] = 29, [2] = 15} // <==>
    int a[6] = {0,0,15,0,29,0}.

Pretty cool! It took me a while to get, because in C99 you don't even need the
=, so you get code in xv6 that looks like this:
  
   static int (*syscalls[])(void) = { [SYS_fork] sys_fork, ... }

Which took me a while to get what I was even looking at, but it's a very neat
way to get a dictionary data structure in C with very little code.

2. If you use strict gcc options, you get an error if you define but don't use a
variable. You can get around this by casting the variable to void:

    int var;
    (void)var;

* Print when a syscall is being made along with the return value
+ Add a system call for getting the date
