Re-scoped SQL practice and some meta-lessons


Today is January 12th, 2016. Considering what I said last time about being
paranoid about things taking more than a few days, I decided to limit the scope
to just the two first sections of pgexercises.com. Here's my progress so far:

Run 1: 8th to 11th January, 30-45m sessions. Total time: 2h 15m.
Run 2: 12th January, 55m.
Run 3: Hopefully tomorrow.

I conducted the tests as a sort of "open book exam". I didn't read "Learn SQL"
or anything like that beforehand, but instead looked things up as I got stuck.

I'll clock in just under a week if I finish tomorrow, and if I hadn't limited
the scope severely I might never have finished. Some meta-lesson are already
clear:

1. Ballpark estimate time for each exercise and take that number times two
2. 30 minutes a day is very little for this type of experiment
3. Being ruthless about cutting scope is good for finishing

* Run 2 of SQL practice, ~1h.
