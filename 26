Attention calculus, part 1


If you write about things you are working on, how much effort should you put
into your writing? Let's look at the proportion between time spent writing (W)
and reading (R).

How should these factors be related? Any definitive answer would be normative in
a bad way, but it's useful to think of each order of magnitude as representing a
higher degree of distillation. I'd venture to say that a "good enough" factor is
around 10x. Here's why, using a basic order of magnitude approximation.

Writers often spend on the order of a year (1000 deliberate hours) writing a
book that takes, say, 10 hours to read. That represents a 100x distillation
factor.

On the other end, a 1x distillation factor is a conversation if it's with one
person, but with' an audience, chances are it's a rant.

If your main thing is writing about what you are doing, rather than the writing
being the doing, "good enough" writing probably work.

What does this mean? If you write a piece that is 1000 words it'd take around 5
minutes to read, so you should spend 1 hour on it.
