Long time no see


January 16th, 2017 in Canggu, Bali. New plan journal entry, first one in a very
long time. Want to use it as a way to keep myself accountable. The last few
weeks I've been working on a spaced repetition tool for retaining programming
knowledge. I'm hoping to get a rough version out the door soon.

I'm trying to always share something useful in these notes, so here's a shell
tip courtesy of vog on HN:

#!/bin/sh
tail -n +3 "@0" | ssh <foo@bar>; exit

echo "hi"
...

The above self-contained script will ssh into some server and run all the
commands in the body of the shell script. Clever.

What did I get done today? "*" means done, " " not done, "-" I decided against
it, and "+" was done at a later date.

* show 'check your inbox' message when registering
* pass through session token properly
* move cards from session cards to user cards when logged in
* accidentally check in mailgun api key (will burn once out of sandbox)
* scheduled cards should check in user-email if user is logged in
  fix review-card command for user null pointer exception
