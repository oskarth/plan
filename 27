Attention calculus, part 2


Let's look at the proportion between doing and writing. Assume you are writing
about things you are doing (D). How much should you do before you write about
it? As a lower bound, you don't want to write about every minutia. What about an
upper bound?

Consider Kahneman's magnus opus Thinking Fast and Slow. It represents the
culmination of 30 years of work (30k hours), and it takes 20 hours to read (more
with footnotes). That's a 1000x factor of D:R. But it's far from the only piece
he (or Tversky) wrote, and it's more a matter of stepwise refinement of the same
core ideas. You don't know in advance what of what you've written will turn out
to have an impact.

With a 10x factor for D:W we end up with a 100x factor from D:R, which is the
same as for writers if we think of them as using another layer of
writing/thinking for distillation.

This leaves us with a D:W:R = 100:10:1. If you spend 1 hour writing about
something you've done, you should've done about 10 hours of work. Obviously,
it's a range, and maybe it's 3x or 30x.
