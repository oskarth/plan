Misc thing done - retroactive entry


As I restructured my code plan notes (see next note) I merged a bunch
of entries into this one. This entry is thus a mash-up of misc things
I've done recently.

* published stack post with video
* paired on Clojurescript excel-ish thingy
* coached a Clojurebridge the whole day
* got lazy page allocation to work in xv6
