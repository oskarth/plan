Many small experiments


Today is January 10th, 2016. This year I want to do many small experiments, and
do write-ups of a few of them on experiments.oskarth.com. This will thus be a
kind of lab notebook, rather than only being about code per se.

Many experiments have been started but have not reached a conclusion
(github.com/oskarth/{instantetymonline, praxis, attentions}). I have noticed
that the longer I've worked on something, the longer the estimated time of
completion is. I.e. spending 1 day on something, it's likely to take 1 more day,
and if I spent a month on something it is likely to take another month to
finish. Others (http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/21/power-law-projects/)
have noticed this as well.

I think a useful attitude to guard against this is to be paranoid about things
taking longer than a few days, especially if it isn't your main commitment in
life.

As a first experiment for this new year, I'm looking into deliberately
practicing SQL. Hypothesis: After working through all the exercises at
pgexercises.com once, the second time will take 1/3 the time, and the third time
a 1/3 of the second time.

* 30 minutes of SQL deliberate practice at pgexercises.com
