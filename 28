Attention calculus, part 3


Playing with these ratios, D:W:R, is kind of a game. But it can also be useful
as a heuristic in how to spend your time. I've had times when I spent too much
time doing things and not enough writing about it, times when I spent too much
time writing, and times when I didn't cut enough words.

There's also a 4th factor: audience (A). Here nonlinearities really set in, so
it's harder to think about, but it can help thinking in terms of giving and
spending attentions. If you spent 100x in a distillation, 100 people reading
your thing seems "fair", in some sense. However, some people spend 1000x and get
very few readers, and others tweet 1x to millions of people. Alas.

What about these three parts I just wrote? They take ~3m to read, I spent 1 hour
writing them, and I've probably spent a few hours thinking about this and
related questions before, which leaves a total ratio of ~50x. This be might be a
tad low, but it is still within the "right" order of magnitude. Was it worth
your attention? I don't know; you tell me.
