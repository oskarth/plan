Examples of Anki cards


1. Conceptual understanding
[sql] Whats difference between WHERE and HAVING?
---
WHERE is used to filter what data gets input to aggregate function, HAVING is used to _filter_ output.

2. Basic debugging
[c] What's wrong in the following part of a word-count program?
state = OUT;
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
nc++;
if (c == '\n')
    nl++;
if (c == ' ' || c == '\t' || c == '\n')
    state = OUT;
else {
    state = IN;
    nw++;
}
---
Last clause should be `else if (state == OUT)`, otherwise we'll keep adding new words

3. Complete code
[scheme] Complete the following for an RPN calculator:
(let rpn ((token (next)) (stk '()))
  (cond ((eq? token 'nl) <stuff>)
  ((number? token) <stuff)
  (else ...))))
---
(rpn (next) (cons ((op token) (cadr stk) (car stk)) (cddr stk)))

4. Cases
[scheme] What are the main cases for a "next" fn for an RPN calculator?
---
1. EOF (exit)
2. Space (skip to next thing)
3. Newline (signal done)
4. Else (for datums like numbers and operators)

5. Idioms
[c] How to read character-by-character from STDIN until EOF?
---
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) { ... }
