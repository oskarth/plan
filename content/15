Back from being offline and restructuring of these notes


Today is July 31, 2015. I recently came back from more than a week of
being completely offline. There's a write-up available at Experi.

I decided to restructure these notes by removing all the ones without
titles (i.e. the ones that had very little content in them). With this
I renumbered all the previous entries, as you can see if you go to
/list. The reason for doing this is because I didn't want to the
entries to be boring. I skimmed over Carmack's original .plan files
and I noticed he didn't actually post every single day, which is what
I previously believed. If not even the insanely productive Carmack
does daily entries, why should I?

Last few days I've been adding a hacky alarm system call that calls a
handler function ever nth hardware tick. Today I just started playing
with some code for understanding how to use locks effectively.
