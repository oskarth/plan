SQL experiment conclusions


Two days ago I finished the third run of my SQL experiment. The general question
I wanted to explore was: how do we become fluent in skills quicky?

As a reminder, my hypothesis was: "After working through all the exercises at
pgexercises.com once, the second time will take 1/3 the time, and the third time
a 1/3 of the second time." Result:

Run 1: 8-11th Jan, 145m
Run 2: 12 Jan, 55m
Run 3: 14 Jan, 35m

My hypothesis was falsified. While the second time around took about a third of the
time, the third run wasn't even twice as fast as the second run.

Observations and notes:
- The 'Basic' section in isolation took ~5m the third run
- I did some SQL outside of these sessions
- The closeness of the session indicates elements of shallow memorization,
  rather than internalization
- I got stuck on certain exercises a lot, such as mistakenly thinking of 
  sub-queries as being namespaced

Questions that were spawned:
- Do you need to learn more complex things in order to master fundamentals?
- How could I have better tackled the exercises/cocnepts that I got stuck on?

* finish SQL experiment
