Alternative explanations to the previous practice+SRS experiment


This is a two week overdue post. Recall entry 21 where I said I was skeptical of
my previous results. Here are some alternative explanations.

Alt 1. Interval too short, problems still fresh in my mind
Alt 2. Problems too easy
Alt 3. Interference in learning
Alt 4. Cards leads to shallow memorization
Alt 5. Spaced repetition small effect, effort of learning and making cards enough

For now, 4 is less of a worry if it leads to being able to do a given tasks in
5m at any future point in time. I also have a hunch that this might be less of a
problem than one might think. 2 is also less of a worry as I'd naturally not
select "too easy cards", since I evidently don't know them well enough, even if
the gotcha is something as simple as syntax or language conventions.

That leaves 1, 3, and 5, which are more serious problems of the system in
question. The next post will show the protocol I'm using to tackle them.

Meta-mistake: I have not been sufficiently paranoid about things taking longer
than a few days (see entry 16).
