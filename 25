Practice+SRS experiment v2, results


Today I tested myself on the 10 problems I previously learned (see 24). Recall
that I split the problems into two groups, one where I practiced spaced
repetition (group A) and one where I didn't (group B). On average, it's been
three weeks since I last solved these problems.

My hypothesis was: Using spaced repetition will allow me to solve problems I've
previously learned to solve twice as fast as if I don't use spaced repetition.

Results: Group A took 18 minutes in total, and all problems were solved in
around 5m. Group B took 46m to solve in total. Group B includes one that I
didn't solve (counted as 20m) and one partial solution that took 11m. I decided
to count the partial solution as a solution as it was mostly correct.

I was thus unable to falsify my hypothesis. This has some caveats though. I just
want to mention one here: Anki tracks the total time spent per card, and summing
up all the cards I did the total time spent rehearsing was 19 minutes.

A longer piece with more fleshed out thoughts will follow soon.
