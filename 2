Coding interview problems and interpreter setbacks


Today I started off doing some coding interview problems. Over the last month or
so I've been working on turning this weakness of mine into a strength. I'm much
better now than I was a month ago, but I still have some way to go. After going
back and forth between various books and resources, I've settled on two
resources: Interview Cake and Hacker Rank. They both have mostly high quality
problems and they complement each other well. My goal is to master the 40 or so
Interview Cake problems, and to reach 75% percentile on Algorihms at Hacker
Rank. After that I think the benefits will start to taper off. We'll see.

The Lisp interpreter is going so-so. I got stuck in a code mess where I had a
bad mental model of what was happening when I was encoding and calling built-in
primitive functions. I decided to start over using LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual
and a legal pad. More tomorrow!

+ get the eval environment to be recognized
* do two interviewcake problems
