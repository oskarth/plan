Learning C and xv6


Reviewed K&R today and did a speed-tour of the first half of the book, writing
some small programs in C and taking notes of constructs I was using that I
wasn't 100% sure on. For example: prefix vs postfix incrementor, pointers, array
initialization and nil-termination.

I've started deep diving into the xv6 source code and booklet, starting with the
shell file as an entry point, looking up any constructs I don't understand with
K&R, man pages, SO, etc. It's a lot of work but I'm slowly and surely getting an
understanding of the code.

Here's another grepism to find all occurrences of fgets in pwd and subdirs, in
.c and .h files:

> grep -r --include=*.{c,h} fgets .

(The reason grep -r fgets *.c *.h doesn't work is because it expands the
filenames before searching recursively.)

* write small programs in C from K&R: wc, strlen, swap.
* complete exec function in xv6 shell
+ get xv6 shell to redir and pipe
