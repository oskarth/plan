SQL experiment #2 - exploring the practice/theory/practice loop


After my last experiment (see /18) I was reminded on Twitter of 'Effective
learning: Twenty rules of formulating knowledge' and specifically about learning
before memorizing. This lead me to wanting to do the following experiment.

Hypothesis:
After spending one hour working through the Aggregate section at pgexercises.com
once, then reading 'Learning SQL' with the goal of understanding
grouping/aggregates for 1h, I will be able to solve the same problems in 20
minutes a few days later.

Result:
Jan 16: Solved 11 first problems of Aggregates in 1h.
Jan 17: Read Aggregates chapter and parts of Subquery chapter for 1h.
Jan 23: Skimmed some of my notes for 2-3m. Solved same problems in 20m.

Conclusion:
I was unable to falsify my hypothesis. The time between 2 and 3 was longer than
I wanted it to be. I added some inference in skimming the notes beforehand.

Misc notes and questions:
- The problem I had before with subqueries not being 'namespaced' is called
  correlated subqueries, and they are run once for each row.
- Can we retain know-how by doing spaced repetition of know-what? I.e. not
  actively practicing but reminding ourselves of basic concepts.
